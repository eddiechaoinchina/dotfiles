# Preamble -------------------------------------- {{{

# Fish - The Friendly Interactive Shell
#
# The reason why I switched from bash and zsh to fish is mainly because of its
# easy scripting and good portability, as well as its fantastic oh-my-fish
# framework for plugin and theme management. Though I have to learn fish
# scripting in addition to bash, it is quite easy to pick up.
#
# The oh-my-fish framework has provided plenty of useful plugins and themes with
# easy installation. The theme I am currently using is the classic robbyrussell,
# which is simple, clean and at the same time pretty clear.
#
# Here are the fish plugins I cannot live without:
# --------------------------------------------
# fzf          | fuzzy finder          | <c-t>
# z            | jump between folders  |
# --------------------------------------------
#
# The fzf plugin needs prerequisite of the fzf package.
